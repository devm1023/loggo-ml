# Motivation
As I was working on a ML problem, there were many bits of code which really took long time. I started adding print() statements to log and track the progress. Then I included timestamp in every print, helps when a same message is printed in a long running loop. Then I added elapsed time. Then made a helper function to prefix the metadata - timestamp, elapsed time, etc. in print statement. And, as the ML program was still training, one hour later, this is what a single line of code turned into!
